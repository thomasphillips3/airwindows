## Description

soft and smooth to nasty, edgy texture-varying filtering, no control smoothing

## Detailed Overview

YNotBandpass has various uses. One I was trying out in the original video, was setting it up as a ‘walkie-talkie’ sort of tone on my voice, and then turning up ResEdge to really trash the hell out of the audio in a characteristic way that’s not easily found anywhere else.

In the video for YNotBandpass, the version without control smoothing, I demoed it on a bunch of huge reverb, alternating between a Bricasti Cathedral and my version of that same sound… and the more rapid switching between Freq settings turns out to sound pretty nice! Except when the ResEdge control is used to give a mean, electrical, circuit-bendy quality that still retains a lot of the depth of the underlying sound.
