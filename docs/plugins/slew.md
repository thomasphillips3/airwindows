## Description

a slew clipper, which darkens treble in an unusual way

## Detailed Overview

Slew is the very first plugin I made for Airwindows (or at least the first one listed on this website).

Slew is a simple plugin to let you do slew clipping. You can use it to morph and transform percussive sounds or hats, you can give a unique and interesting ‘grind’ to instruments or glue stuff together into a retro, old-school-sampler, grungey grind, or you can use it on things like reverb sends to really amp up the sense of distant loud sound in a room or space.

## How It Works

Slew processes audio in the Brightness category. See the description above for specific functionality.

## Usage Tips

- Start with conservative settings
- A/B compare to hear the effect clearly
- Use in context with other processing
- Trust your ears over visual meters
