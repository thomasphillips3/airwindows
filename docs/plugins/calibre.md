## Description

a re-release of another old Character plugin

## Detailed Overview

Calibre is another Character plugin, re-released in AU and VST form. This one’s got kind of a steely quality and if you hype the Character control there’s a point where bass cancels out: weird variation on a tone control! Also, that means if you duplicated the track (or used Blue Cat Patchwork or something) and flipped phase, you’d get a really unusual lowpass and would have only the bass and a lot of strange color.

## How It Works

Calibre processes audio in the Tone Color category. See the description above for specific functionality.

## Usage Tips

- Start with conservative settings
- A/B compare to hear the effect clearly
- Use in context with other processing
- Trust your ears over visual meters
