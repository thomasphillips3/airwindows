## Description

a very flexible amplike thing with a taste for the bizarre

## Detailed Overview

Let’s go a little farther! BigAmp steps even farther away from what you might call ‘realistic’ amp sim behavior. It’s more like the Z series filters, or perhaps the X filters: you can make it act sort of ‘normal’, but it also lets you twist the knobs way beyond what’s realistic. So, you can use BigAmp for layering, or to supplement a sound, or just do strange things. There’s one more amp sim before I get into other, different plugins (and indeed different whole things like the sample instruments I’m developing, as heard in ‘Skronk’ and these demos) but BigAmp is perhaps the widest-ranging of the lot.

## How It Works

BigAmp processes audio in the Amp Sims category. See the description above for specific functionality.

## Usage Tips

- Start with conservative settings
- A/B compare to hear the effect clearly
- Use in context with other processing
- Trust your ears over visual meters
