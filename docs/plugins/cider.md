## Description

a re-release of another old Character plugin

## Detailed Overview

Cider is another Character plugin. Works like the last few, sounds kinda like an MCI console? This plugin was posted on a week full of troubles, so there's very little instruction about it. It's a tone coloring plugin, and you can find a more current version of this sound in BussColors4 on the Dark setting.

## How It Works

Cider processes audio in the Tone Color category. See the description above for specific functionality.

## Usage Tips

- Start with conservative settings
- A/B compare to hear the effect clearly
- Use in context with other processing
- Trust your ears over visual meters
