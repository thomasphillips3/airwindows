## Description

soft and smooth to nasty, edgy texture-varying filtering, no control smoothing

## Detailed Overview

See YNotLowpass, except itâ€™s a highpass :) interestingly, the original YHighpass saw some significant improvements in CPU usage. Turns out that going to YNot mode, with no control smoothing, boosts performance even more.

You can use YNotHighpass (or the control-smoothed version, YHighpass) to do a really unnatural, abrasive sweep up into the supersonic. It's not just about increasing resonance: the ResEdge does an unusual, nasty thing to the tone, and used as a highpass it's a really distinctive sound. I don't think it would work as a consistent part of anybody's tone for anything, but for that very reason it might be great as an unexpected move :)

Hope you like YNotHighpass, and I'm working on a whole bunch of more generally useful things that take longer to develop.
